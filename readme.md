# Movie Recommendation System – Baseline Models

This project implements multiple baseline recommender system approaches using the MovieLens 100k dataset.  
The objective is to understand data preparation for recommender systems and implement traditional recommendation techniques.

---

## Dataset

MovieLens 100k dataset containing:
- User ratings
- Movie metadata
- User demographic information

---

## Project Workflow

1. Data loading and merging  
2. Data cleaning and preprocessing  
3. Rating and interaction validation  
4. Construction of user–movie matrix  
5. Implementation of baseline recommender models  

---

## Implemented Models

### 1. Popularity-Based Recommender
Recommends movies based on highest average rating and minimum rating count.

### 2. Item-Based Collaborative Filtering
Recommends movies similar to a given movie using item–item similarity.

### 3. User-Based Collaborative Filtering
Recommends movies to a user based on similarity between users.

## Technologies Used

- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  

---

## Results

The system can generate movie recommendations using different baseline strategies and demonstrates the behavior of traditional collaborative filtering methods.
